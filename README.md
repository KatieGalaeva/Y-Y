# **Yandex Course: Machine Learning and Algorithms**

This repository contains various assignments, projects, and materials from a Yandex course focusing on **Machine Learning** and **Algorithms**. Throughout the course, we tackled a range of topics and participated in hackathons related to **machine translation** and **audio processing**.

## **Repository Structure**

- **algorithms_6.0**  
  Materials and solutions related to advanced algorithms (graph theory, dynamic programming, etc.).

- **nlp_2.0**  
  Projects focused on Natural Language Processing, such as text classification and tokenization.

## **Highlights**

- **Hackathons**  
  - **Machine Translation**: Explored sequence-to-sequence models, transformers, and evaluation metrics (BLEU score).  
  - **Audio Processing**: Dealt with tasks audio classification using deep learning frameworks.

- **Algorithms**  
  Topics include sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and complexity analysis.
